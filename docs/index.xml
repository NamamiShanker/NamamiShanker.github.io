      <description>Numpy and Scipy are industry leading Python libraries for fast numerical computation, providing speed and accuracy matching MATLAB and highly optimized low-level numerical computation libraries. In this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll explain to you how they work and how can you create your own superfast Python library.
SciPy The name SciPy is a well-known scientific computation industry. Every engineer, researcher, teacher or student who has used Python has used Scipy at least once or more in their career.</description>
