      <description>Week 6: Continuing working on the frontend argparse What did I do this week? I implemented some changes suggested by reviewers on my draft PR.
Firstly, I added typing support to the functions I have made. Therefore, currently: f2pyarg.py, service.py, utils.py have typing support. Initially I had added typing library for type annotations. But Bas Van Beek suggested to replace them with buitlins type annotations. These are not currently supported in Python versions below 3.</description>
