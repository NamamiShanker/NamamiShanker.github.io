      <description>Week 3 and 4: Argparse F2PY The much awaited F2PY with an argparse frontend is here. It is in review as I write this blog but if you are feeling adventurous and can&amp;rsquo;t wait use it, you can clone my fork of NumPy and checkout the f2py_front branch. Installation of this experimental NumPy version are detailed in these instructions.(Of course I am joking, no one who gets excited over F2PY builds NumPy)</description>
