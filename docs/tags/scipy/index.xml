      <description>Week 3 and 4: Argparse F2PY The much awaited F2PY with an argparse frontend is here. It is in review as I write this blog but if you are feeling too excited and can&amp;rsquo;t wait use it, you can clone my fork of NumPy at f2py_front branch and install this experimental NumPy version using these instructions.(Of course I am joking, no one gets excited over F2PY)
Lets dive into the changes that have taken place:-</description>

      <description>Numpy and Scipy are industry leading Python libraries for fast numerical computation, providing speed and accuracy matching MATLAB and highly optimized low-level numerical computation libraries. In this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll explain to you how they work and how can you create your own superfast Python library.
SciPy The name SciPy is very well-known in the scientific computation industry. Every engineer, researcher, teacher or student who has used Python has used Scipy at least once or more in their career.</description>
