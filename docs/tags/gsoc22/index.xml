      <description>GSoC&amp;rsquo;22 Work Submission and closing remarks Closing remarks Participating in Google Summer of Code 2022 with NumPy was more than just contributing to a summer coding internship for me. I remember walking around my college hostel along with my friend during the first year of my engineering in 2019 discussing what do we want to achieve over the course of our undergraduate education. Back then too, I remember that my first wish ever, even before I knew what open sources was to participate in the Google Summer of Code.</description>

      <description>I applied for Google Summer of Code 2022 to work with NumPy&amp;rsquo;s F2PY maintainence team and improve F2PY under Python Software Foundation. Breifly said, F2PY is a CLI that provides an easy connection between Python and Fortran languagues. I have previously dicussed F2PY on my website on the topics Scipy, Fortran and F2PY and F2PY tests.
During my time of application, F2PY&amp;rsquo;s frontend was a handwritten command line parser with handwritten interfacing.</description>
