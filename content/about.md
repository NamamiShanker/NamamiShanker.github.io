### Who am I?
I am Namami Shanker, an Electrical Engineering Undergraduate in his 3rd year at [Indian Institute of Technology, Goa](https://www.iitgoa.ac.in/). I have been working as a software developer for over a year. I have experience in backend development, database management, dockerising and orchestrating applications with docker and docker-compose. I am an open-source enthusiast and I am always looking to learn new technologies and frameworks. Being an engineering student, I have a geniune interest in mathematics and scientific computing. I believe that you can never become a master of a skill: you can only improve yourself by learning from others. Therefore, I habitually read code repositories and contribute to keep on becoming better. You can have a look on my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/NamamiShanker).

### Where have I worked?

##### DroneBase
I also interned as a **python/backend intern** at [DroneBase](https://dronebase.com) from August 2021 to January 2022. DroneBase is a diagnosis and analysis company in the renewable energy sector. It was a uncommon corporate firm consisting of brilliant developers who aimed to develop analysis tools to monitor renewable energy farms (eg Wind Farm, Solar Farm) using drones and thermal cameras. The clients of this company were energy giants around the world like [Tata Solar Power](https://www.tatapowersolar.com/) India, and many more from developed countries in Asia. I worked with a team of 20+ experienced engineers to develop backend APIs and test suites with Flask and Pytest. The tests I implemented skyrocketed development speed up to 2 times. The experience I gained with API development, Database engineering and writing scalable, testable and maintainable code is invaluable.

##### Q-in-1
I believe that a college students' expenses should be managed by him/herself. I learned how to code in Python during the first semester of my engineering and started teaching school children (age 14 to 18) how to code. You will be surprised to know how much I learned by teaching school kids. [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) states that if you have truly understood a concept, you should be able to teach it to a 12 year old. This small part-time job solidified the basics of coding, Machine Learning, and web development in me more that any of my coursework did. Plus, I enjoyed a generous cmount of stipend and enjoyed the beginning years of my college.

### What am I doing?
Currently I am planning to take part in Google Summer of Code. I have some contributions to [Scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/). I am still a beginner in development, and I am really interested in Scientific Computing. I got involved with Scipy in 2020 when I they released they released their project [idea list](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/wiki/GSoC-2021-project-ideas) for GSoC 2021. I wanted to work on this project, however, I missed GSoC applications as I came to know about it too late. Since then, I have been actively contributing to Scipy and I am looking forward to be a part of it. I like learning and I like teaching, and open-source in a great way to do both.

Parallely, I am working on this website you are looking at. It is my personal website where I plan to release my projects and share my thoughts. I am also planning to release blogs about my work in open source libraries like Numpy and Scipy, and a blog series about backend development in Flask.
